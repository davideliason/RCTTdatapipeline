Notes
- Amazon Bedrock- Fine Tuning is $$, but can use **transfer Leraning** to add to pre-trained models
- you add to the learning model, for exmple adding a chatbot with a particular tone or special info
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** & **Knowledge Base**:
- allows a Foundation Modelto ref a data sourrce outside of its training data
- adds complexity: have to create vector DB which Bedrock creates vectors from text and stores in. These are referenced with a qquery
